    "fullContent": "The Dow reached our 61.8% retracement target at 45,922.99, securing partial profits from the 76.4% short near 46,675 before rebounding. The bounce shows that buy-the-dip psychology remains alive, keeping this phase a test of equity resilience rather than a confirmed reversal. Momentum has yet to break decisively higher, but volatility is picking up — and if negativities magnify, more vol and more bearishness will follow.",
